# SimpleWordlists
A collection of easy to use word lists from various web sources.

# Synoyms and Antonyms
Originally from princeton wordnet  (https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) these synonyms and antonyms are the condensed version of (https://github.com/airshipcloud/dictionary-seed/tree/master/wordnet/Thesaurus). 
The versions have been removed and all synonyms and antonyms for a word are grouped together.
The common versions have been filtered against the 12dict-2of12 (http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/#classic) which contains common words and phrases only.

# Nouns, Adverbs, Verbs, Adjectives
These wordlists are from http://www.ashley-bovan.co.uk/words/partsofspeech.html

# Common Audited Adjectives and Nouns
These lists have been human (an American human) audited to be normal everyday words, safe for children and non-offensive.
The source of this list was Moby parts of speech (http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/mpos.html) and Ashley Bovan (http://www.ashley-bovan.co.uk/words/partsofspeech.html)
Unfortunately these only come in len 3-6 as we didn't waste the auditors time with longer words as we only wanted 3-6 ourselves.
